# About the course  

### Machine learning in a nutshell  
- Understand data
- Do statistics 
- Write codes

```{r, out.width = "350em", echo=FALSE, fig.caption=""}
knitr::include_graphics("fun/draw_dog.png")
```


# _Week 1 quick pool_
### Wednesday sessions
>- Highlight/Review/Supplement lectures?
>- R programming demo? 
>- Additional exercise problems? 
>- ~~Kayaking, Barbecue, Deriving homework problems~~


# What we'll do today
<div class="incremental">  
###Introduction to R
>- Haven't used R at all? 
>		- Don't worry, it's just another programming language
>- Haven't programmed at all? 
>		- Don't worry, it's just a fancy calculator (sort of)

###Documentation with R
- R Markdown
</div>

# Start using R 
<div class="incremental">  
### R
>+ a programming language and software environment for statistics
>+ many packages to use for even very complicated models
>+ Very easy setup with most OS environments (most of the time)  
>+ Download: [https://cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)

### RStudio
>+ Download: [http://www.rstudio.com/download](http://www.rstudio.com/download)
>+ Using Rstudio is totally optional, but usually it makes life easier
	+ Syntax highlighting
	+ Nice organization of windows
	+ Auto-saving codes when crashes
	+ Much easier for R Markdown	

### Try for yourself
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
print("Hello, World!")
```
</div>
# Basics
>- Highlight codes in the editor window and click Run or hit Cntl-Enter (Command-Enter on a Mac) to run 
>- Type lines in the console and press Enter
>- Making sure the the lines you typed are finished
>		+ If not, you will see a '+' in front of the line
>		+ Finish the line or hit ESC to escape 
>- Now, try calculating "8 + 24 + 23" and $\sqrt{2}$ in R
>- Try look for help with functions using '?'  

# Example from ISL
>- Section 2.3 from ISL
>		- Construct vectors, matrices, and draw random numbers
>		- Basic scatter plot and contour plots
>		- Load ans summarize data
>- Section 3.6 from ISL
>		- Simple linear regression
>		- Multiple regression
>- Section 4.6.5 from ISL
>		- KNN (homework) 

# Basic R codes
#### Initialize and construct vectors
```{r, Vectors_and_Matrices}
```

#### Generate Random numbers following normal distribution
```{r, Random_Numbers}
```

#### Generate Random numbers following other distributions
```{r, Random_Numbers_2}
```

#### Scatter plot
```{r, Plot}
```

#### Customizing scatter plots
```{r, Plot_2}
```

# Regression example
#### Read data
- The MASS library contains the Boston data set, which records _medv_ (median house value) for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. 
- Predict _medv_ using 13 predictors such as 
	- rm (average number of rooms per house), 
	- age (average age of houses), 
	- lstat (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).
```{r, Regression_1}
```
#### Regression
- You should have seen this before
```{r, Regression_2}
```

#### Diagnostics
- How about confidence intervals for the regression coefficients
```{r, Regression_3}
```
- Visual check of 
	- residual against fitted values 
	- QQ plot of residuals
- _Why do we want to see these plots?_
```{r, Regression_4}
```

#### More regressors
```{r, Regression_5}
```

# Trick of R programming
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<center> <h2>Practice! </h2> </center>

# Fun stuff, finally, what we are all here for :)
```{r, Fun, eval=FALSE}
```
Try on your laptop :) Then we'll talk some serious business.

# R Markdown
> - Reporting tool to combine everything together
>		- code
> 		- result
> 		- comment/discussion
> - Easy to get started with RStudio
> - Good for Homework
> 		- Not required though, MS Word is perfectly accept as long as it is clear and readable 



# R Markdown Demo
>- Choose File > New File > R Markdownâ€¦
>- Make sure HTML output is selected and click OK
>- Save the file somewhere, call it demo.Rmd
>- Click the Knit HTML button
>- Find the HTML file and open in browser

# R Markdown Demo
>- _Saving a PDF file is tricky_
>- You will need to install TEX on your computer
>		- [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
>- An Alternative way is to print your HTML file to PDF
>- _For HW submission_, HTML file is enough. But to be absolutely safe, upload both HTML file and RMD file.

# R Markdown Syntax
- Header block
- **bold**: `**bold**`
- italic: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- Header: `# Header`
- Subheader: `## Subheader`
- Subsubheader: `### Subsubheader`
- Code chunks:  
 

		```{r}`r ''`
		x <- 1:10
		y <- 2:11
		plot(x, y)
		```

# R Markdown for Homework

### Check out the Homework template on canvas!
```{r, out.width = "600em", echo=FALSE, fig.caption=""}
knitr::include_graphics("fun/template.png")
```

# More logistics, class Resources
### _Office hours or email me to schedule a time_
### _Canvas discussion board_
- Phrase your question so that other people can answer
- Give codes that other people can run _and replicate your problem_

#### Bad examples

1. I ran the regression codes but it didn't work
2. I have ``lm(y ~ x)" in my codes but it didn't work

#### Good example
I tried the following codes and the error message says: variable lengths differ (found for 'x')
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(1:10)
y <- seq(1:100)
model <- lm(y ~ x)
```
